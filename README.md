PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The problem statement is that individuals who live in urban areas or have limited storage space face difficulties in finding suitable options for renting or borrowing items for short periods of time. Traditional rental services or borrowing from friends and family may not always be available or convenient. This subset of people requires a platform that specifically addresses their needs for short-term access to items, which is simple, affordable, and convenient.

SOLUTION:
Our proposal is a web-based platform that connects people who are interested in renting or purchasing secondhand items with individuals who possess unused possessions that they can lease or sell. Our ultimate goal is to promote sustainable consumption and reduce waste by establishing a peer-to-peer market. The website's users can publish their unused items for rent or sale, determine their own pricing, and conduct secure financial transactions with other users. This approach provides an easy and convenient method for engaging in sustainable consumption while also reducing the amount of waste generated by unused items.

In addition, our platform has a search filter that assists users in finding items that suit their specific requirements. This feature improves the user experience by allowing individuals to locate the items they need more quickly and easily. To ensure a secure and dependable environment for exchanging goods, we have developed an authentication system that verifies the identity of our users. This mechanism safeguards the interests of both renters/sellers and buyers, instilling trust in the exchange process.

Overall, our platform is designed to encourage community involvement, foster a sharing economy, and promote sustainable consumption practices.
